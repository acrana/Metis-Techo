METIS, named after the Greek Titan goddess of wisdom, represents my exploration into how AI and machine learning can enhance medical decision-making.

METIS is an AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System that monitors patient data in real-time and predicts potential risks. While built with test data, this project demonstrates the potential of combining clinical knowledge with modern technology to support safer healthcare delivery.


## Core Features
- Real-time patient vital sign monitoring
- ML-driven risk prediction using PyTorch
- Medication interaction analysis
- Clinical trend visualization
- Automated alert system

## Technical Implementation
- Machine Learning: PyTorch for risk prediction models
- Frontend: PySide6 for desktop interface
- Backend: SQLite database for clinical data
- Data Analysis: Real-time processing of patient metrics

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch
- PySide6
- SQLite

The experience gained from building METIS will help guide my learning. Key learning outcomes include understanding the importance of a strong foundational database.
