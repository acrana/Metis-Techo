### ICP_CO2
- A browser-based tool to explore how CO₂ levels affect brain pressure (ICP) and blood flow (CBF) after traumatic brain injury. Adjust CO₂ with sliders or hyperventilation to see real-time changes in graphs and waveforms, with clear alerts like "Low CBF: Less oxygen to brain." Great for learning the balance between managing pressure and ensuring oxygen delivery.
