# Healthcare Technology Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio exploring technology's potential to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Each project represents a step in learning and developing skills that can make a difference in clinical care.

## Projects

### [AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System (AICDSS)](https://github.com/acrana/Metis-Techo/tree/main/AICDSS)

METIS, named after the Greek Titan goddess of wisdom, combines machine learning with clinical data to enhance medical decision-making. This learning project features:
- ML-driven risk prediction with PyTorch
- Medication interaction analysis
- Clinical trend visualization
- Automated alert system

### [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Prediction](https://github.com/acrana/Metis-Techo/tree/main/CLABSI)
CLABSI is a serious, life-threatening complication in critically ill patients. This project leverages data from the MIMIC-IV database to build an explainable machine learning model for predicting CLABSI risk. By identifying key factors that contribute to infection risk, the model aims to support early intervention and improve patient outcomes.
 - FHIR API (In Progress)
